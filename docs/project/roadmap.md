## Current Source Of Truth

The active direction is to make KP's semantic animation runtime the center of
the project, with the project dashboard as the operational catalog and authoring
surface. The ordering principle is:

```text
semantics first
-> runtime second
-> renderers third
-> authoring and generation fourth
```

## Active Focus

**Tutorial-card runtime foundation.** The tutorial-card runtime loop closed on
2026-07-10 with manifest resolution, parent timeline sampling, synchronized
layout binding, equation/graph frame adapters, a live linear-solve card shell,
rewind verification, SourceFile selectors, dependency planning, iframe/static
step export profile metadata, and refreshed dashboard readiness in place.

The next major implementation loop should package that runtime into concrete
exports: `KpTutorialCardManifest -> parent timeline -> synchronized layout ->
sampled frames -> iframe/static-step artifact`, with GIF/video and programming
panels following only after the first artifacts are real.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 0: Project Memory Bootstrap

Status: active

Create the `docs/project` layer, tie it to Theseus, and make long-term strategy
separate from executable run contracts. This phase is complete when the
strategy, roadmap, active threads, decision record, and next-step review exist.

### Phase 1: Semantic Object Foundation

Status: next

Formalize the shared object protocol:

- stable IDs and selector paths;
- immutable structural updates with provenance;
- traits and predicates instead of type explosion;
- capabilities for render, select, derive, execute, transform, compare,
  diagnose, animate, and link;
- a registry that can advertise metadata without loading every capability.

### Phase 2: Derive And Representation Capability

Status: next

Add the first-class ability to move between exact semantic representations:

- `Expression -> LaTeX`;
- `Expression -> Graph2D`;
- `Equation -> Graph2D` when classifiable;
- `Graph2D -> LaTeX` only when symbolic provenance exists;
- `Matrix -> LinearMap`;
- `LinearMap -> Matrix` in a basis;
- `Rotation` or `Scale -> Matrix`.

The core rule is provenance honesty: sampled data can expose samples and fits,
but it must not pretend to be exact symbolic math.

### Phase 3: Semantic Transformation Composition

Status: next

Make transformations compose as first-class objects:

- sequence;
- parallel;
- nested/higher-order transforms;
- transformation provenance;
- correspondence composition;
- reversible visual motif timelines;
- editable transformation trees for pauses, focus, and emphasis.

This is where matrix multiplication can be composed from dot products, and a
tutorial can edit emphasis without changing semantic truth.

### Phase 4: KaTeX Transform Library

Status: next

Use equations as the proof lab. Grow transform fixtures and semantic coverage
for:

- fractions;
- radicals;
- exponents and subscripts;
- function wrapping;
- distribution and factoring;
- cancellation and simplification;
- matrix bracket/entry preservation;
- large operators, limits, sums, products, and integrals;
- unusual geometry such as roots, stacked fractions, and wrapped expressions.

Each fixture should clarify identity, artifacts, persistent tokens, and visual
motifs.

### Phase 5: Graph And Visual Runtime Unification

Status: next

Bring graph behavior onto the same clock and transformation model:

- graph surface morphs;
- camera and projection transitions;
- vector transforms;
- tangent line and tangent plane;
- Jacobian and Hessian comparison views;
- local linearization and curvature scenes;
- 2D/3D synchronized equation and graph panels.

Graph renderers should consume sampled frames, not own semantic timing.

### Phase 6: Dashboard As Authoring Catalog

Status: active

Promote the dashboard from project tracker to authoring/catalog surface:

- one row per work item, object, transform, visual, sample, report card, and
  protocol;
- fuzzy search across everything;
- selected-row previews;
- sample actions into live editor cards;
- API sample targets;
- visible blockers, maturity, source refs, and verification records;
- future writeback from structured docs/JSON and Theseus nodes.

### Phase 7: Tutorial Composition And Layout Objects

Status: active

Add first-class layout and tutorial composition:

- row, column, stack, grid, split, tabs, overlay, scroll sequence, pinned stage;
- synchronized panels;
- timeline markers and annotations;
- focus/unfocus as presentation transformations;
- nested tutorial cards and comparison cards.

### Phase 8: Computation, Curriculum, And Cards

Status: parked-next

Build the verified learning layer:

- problem templates and problem instances;
- solution steps and verification;
- assessment items;
- spaced-repetition cards;
- learner memory and review events;
- concept graph with prerequisites, misconceptions, canonical objects, and
  animation motifs.

### Phase 9: Export And Embed

Status: active

Package executable tutorials as semantic capsules:

- web component or iframe embeds;
- lazy capability manifests;
- cheap fallbacks before WebGL/Three.js loads;
- GIF, MP4/WebM, and static-step exports.

## Near-Term Priorities

1. Package the iframe export profile into a minimal embeddable tutorial-card
   artifact with fallbacks and controls.
2. Generate a static step-sequence artifact from sampled parent timeline
   checkpoints.
3. Add a programming tutorial-card panel that consumes `SourceFile` selectors.
4. Add a lightweight browser/runtime smoke check for the live tutorial card
   shell.
5. Return to KaTeX transform fixtures and graph panels with the parent timeline
   as the required clock boundary.

## Deferred

- Full curriculum and spaced repetition are deferred until object,
  transformation, and computation protocols are reliable.
- GIF/video export is deferred until iframe and static-step artifacts are
  concrete and verifiable.
- Broad Theseus planner infrastructure is deferred unless it directly blocks KP
  roadmap execution.
